rsync - invokes process

-a, --archive
This is equivalent to -rlptgoD. It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and want to preserve almost everything (with -H being a notable omission). The only exception to the above equivalence is when --files-from is specified, in which case -r is not implied.

	-r recursive
	-l copy symbolic links as symbolic links
	-p preserve permissions 
	-t preserve modification times
	-g preserve group
	-o preserve owner
	-D preserve device files, preserve special files

-v, --verbose
This option increases the amount of information you are given during the transfer. By default, rsync works silently. A single -v will give you information about what files are being transferred and a brief summary at the end. Two -v options will give you information on what files are being skipped and slightly more information at the end. More than two -v options should only be used if you are debugging rsync.

-r, --recursive
This tells rsync to copy directories recursively. See also --dirs (-d).

--progress
This option tells rsync to print information showing the progress of the transfer. This gives a bored user something to watch. Implies --verbose if it wasn't already specified.

--stats
This tells rsync to print a verbose set of statistics on the file transfer, allowing you to tell how effective rsync's delta-transfer algorithm is for your data.
